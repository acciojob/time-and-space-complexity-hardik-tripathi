	<h1>Information about Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually measured in terms of the number of operations performed relative to the size of the input. It's a crucial factor in evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. Efficient algorithms have a lower time complexity, indicating they require fewer computational resources and execute faster. Typically, time complexity is expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the number of steps an algorithm takes. For instance, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(1) is more efficient than one with O(n^2), as it performs the same operation in constant time regardless of input size, whereas the latter's execution time increases exponentially with input size. Understanding time complexity helps developers optimize their code and create more efficient solutions.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>:
Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, usually expressed in terms of the input size. It's an essential consideration in algorithm design, as excessive memory usage can lead to performance issues and slow down systems. Space complexity is typically represented using Big O notation, similar to time complexity. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(1) uses a constant amount of memory regardless of input size, whereas an algorithm with O(n) space complexity requires memory that scales linearly with the input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity are generally more efficient and scalable, making them preferable in applications where memory resources are limited. Effective management of space complexity enables developers to write more efficient and reliable code.</p>
